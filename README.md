# Big-U

Big-U is an autism resource application for parents of autistic children, and adults with autism. This enables you to log entries about your daily struggles and add/contribute resources to help with better understanding ASD.

## Installation

Fork and clone the front end repository here and navigate to folder (probably best to open a second tab in the terminal for this)

```bash
cd big-u-frontend
```

## Usage

You will want to make sure to install the dependencies for the application to run properly. After everything is installed follow the below.

```bash
#install gems
npm install

# run the react server
npm start
```

The server will auto-open in your browser and as long as everything has initialized properly you will be on the home page.

## Backend

If you haven't followed the backend properly please navigate there first in order to proceed.
