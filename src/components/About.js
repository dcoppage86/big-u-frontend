            <strong>Hi, I'm Dakota Coppage</strong>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <p>At the age of 6 our daughter, Fynleigh, was diagnosed with ASD aka Austism Spectrum Disorder. This was hard for us at first,
            and many questions arose.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Will Fynleigh be able to lead a normal life?</li>
                <li>Will we be able to handle all the changes in our lives to accomodate our daughters needs?</li>
                <li>Will people understand?</li>
                <li>How can we teach them?</li>
                <li>Are we in this alone?</li>
            </ol>

            <br></br>
            <p>This is definitely normal but we found that most of these answer themselves. MOST IMPORTANTLY...</p>
            <strong>YOU ARE NOT ALONE</strong>
